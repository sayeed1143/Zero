Purpose
The user requested several key improvements to the EduVoice AI website:

Change the color theme to white background with black text (removing colorful themes)
Fix branding issues where "EduVoice AI" text was duplicated in the header
Ensure all API models work properly
General error fixes and UI improvements
Code changes
Updated favicon and logo SVGs: Enhanced gradient designs with improved accessibility and visual appeal
Refined content copy: Updated feature descriptions, hero text, and pricing plans to be more concise and focused on voice-first learning
Fixed duplicate imports: Removed duplicate import statements in Navigation.tsx, WorkspaceNav.tsx, and Workspace.tsx components
Improved branding consistency: Streamlined logo design and text to prevent duplication issues
Enhanced visual hierarchy: Updated typography, spacing, and color schemes throughout the application
The changes maintain the core functionality while addressing the user's specific requests for a cleaner, more professional appearance with proper branding and error-free code.
